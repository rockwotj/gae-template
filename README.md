# Google App Engine Template

This is my template for Google App Engine (GAE) Golang projects.

Feel free to steal this and use it for your own servers. 
The need for this arose when a lot of my GAE projects needed
the same structure. A RESTful API, with a CRON and some static files. 

This seems to work well for me. Hope it's useful!
